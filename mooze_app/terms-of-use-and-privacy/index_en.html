    <h1 style="color:#00ff88;margin-bottom:12px;">Terms of use and privacy</h1>

<p>Last updated: 05/16/2024</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"> <p>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2></p>

<p>By using the Mooze application, you fully agree to these Terms of Use. This document establishes the rules for using the Mooze application, a digital units management app with intercommunication functionalities and transfers interconnected with the real world and the Brazilian FIAT currency reference. The app aims to provide greater transactional description and data protection for users, similar to the privacy offered by the use of FIAT cash — a right supported by fundamental constitutional guarantees of privacy and the inviolability of private life, as provided in Article 5, Item X of the Brazilian Federal Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>2. User Responsibilities</h2></p>

<p>– The user is solely responsible for keeping their recovery passwords of their digital units in self-custody within the app secure. The loss of this information results in the irreversible loss of the digital units inside our application.</p>

<p>– Mooze does not store, nor has access to private keys or distributed ledger data of the app’s operations that access users’ digital unit funds.</p>

<p>– By using the “merchant mode” through the DEPIX.INFO operations system in the Mooze app, the user fully accepts the terms and is legally responsible for actions performed, whether their own or by third parties who use the app as a management tool under the user’s physical custody of the device.</p>

<p>– Instant operations in Brazilian FIAT value reference result only in registered operations of DEPIX.INFO digital units, a digital unit equal in value to the Brazilian FIAT reference.</p>

<p>– The conversion of digital units different from the Brazilian FIAT reference will occur automatically within the user’s application. Mooze does not carry out operations in the traditional Brazilian financial system; it only enables the movement of digital units and automated swaps of pairable digital units. This means that all transactions at the DEPIX.INFO entry point, upon receiving other digital units in the app when selecting assets other than DEPIX, the user is only programming an automated swap of their DEPIX for another digital unit they want. The DEPIX obtained or received via digital unit gateways pegged to the Brazilian FIAT reference are swapped through a user request within their own app and sent from Mooze’s reserve account. There is no user digital unit custody at any time in the operations of technologies aggregated in the Mooze app or by Mooze itself.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>2.1. Irreversible catastrophic user actions</h2></p>

<p>– When using the Mooze app and creating a user account by obtaining recovery words and private passwords or importing access with external private keys, the user is responsible for saving their passwords in a secure place. These passwords are the only way the user can recover access to their digital units in self-custody. The entire digital unit system of the app is in the user’s self-custody, not Mooze’s nor the aggregated partner technologies’.</p>

<p>– If the user experiences any issues with digital unit transfers, whether by personal use or through receiving digital units via transactions in Brazilian FIAT value reference through DEPIX.INFO, and if the user uninstalls the application without saving their passwords securely for later recovery, they will lose permanent access to their funds. This is an exclusive self-custody responsibility of the user. Mooze and its technology partners cannot recover these passwords, as they are generated in the user’s device and only the user has access. This is a characteristic of self-custody systems: the custodian bears full responsibility for safeguarding access, and lack of care will result in this and other consequences inherent to sovereign self-custody systems.</p>

<p>– Do not uninstall the app without saving your private recovery keys, especially if you have digital funds in the app or pending units to receive. Doing so may cause permanent loss of funds. In case of problems with digital unit transfers, do not uninstall the app — save your private keys and, if necessary, contact Mooze support at <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a> or via the <a href="https://t.me/Moozep2pbot" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Telegram support channel</a>.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>2.2. Security behaviors and technologies</h2></p>

<p>– Mooze has cryptographic data protection systems for user IDs and transaction requests with partner companies of EULEN.APP, such as Plebank in Brazil. Digital unit transaction data is guaranteed by distributed ledger cryptographic technology via the Liquid Network by Blockstream or similar decentralized open-source cryptographic ledgers. Responsibility for FIAT reference operations in Brazil lies with Plebank, which maintains its own security and compliance systems in the country.</p>

<p>– Mooze does not provide systems for account recovery or access to users’ digital units in case private keys are lost. The custody is the sole responsibility of the user.</p>

<p>– The user must keep their private keys safe. If leaked through unsafe notes or poor storage, malicious actors may gain access to their digital funds. Loss of funds may also occur in cases of physical compromise of the user’s device. Mooze is not responsible for such cases and offers no system to block unauthorized access from leaked private keys. Avoid saving keys in insecure digital places; preferably keep them physically secured.</p>

<p>– Unauthorized physical access to the user’s device, through coercion, theft, or loss, places full responsibility on the user for safeguarding their private keys and device. By using the app, the user accepts these risks.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>3. Limitation of Liability</h2></p>

<p>– Mooze is not responsible for losses or issues resulting from app use, especially in cases involving network failures (e.g., distributed ledger forks), unconfirmed transactions, or user misuse. Distributed ledger networks where transaction histories are scanned are controlled by third parties (e.g., Blockstream, Sideswap, or decentralized open-source systems), not Mooze.</p>

<p>– The Mooze app operates as an open BETA. The user acknowledges that issues may occur until a stable version is released. In case of critical problems preventing digital unit movements, the private keys of Mooze app users are compatible with recovery in the Blockstream GREEN app. If the user recovers their keys there, they may move funds in case of critical incompatibility or app code failures. To view the suggested “fallback” app, Blockstream GREEN, click here.</p>

<p>– Mooze and its digital unit processors do not participate in user-client activities. The Mooze app is only a technological bridge, aggregating technologies from companies like EULEN.APP and DEPIX.INFO. Commercial use of the app is entirely the user’s responsibility. Mooze does not handle accounting or tax data insertion (e.g., invoices). Users may regularize independently under Brazilian law, using the corporate entities (CNPJ) of processors like Plebank.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>4. Monetary valuation</h2></p>

<p>– For digital units not pegged to Brazilian official FIAT, Mooze will scan major market sources to obtain an average and generate its own pricing within the app.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>5. Fees and Confirmations</h2></p>

<p>a) Fees include: – Network fees (charged by distributed ledger networks).</p>

<p>– Operational fees for Brazilian FIAT reference transactions processed by EULEN.APP partners.</p>

<p>– Transferred units will already include all applicable fees.</p>

<p>b) Confirmations: – In case of issues with instant FIAT reference transactions or internal app transfers, support should be contacted at <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a>.</p>

<p>– All operations are protected by Liquid Network technology against data leaks and exposure to unauthorized third parties.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>6. What Mooze DOES NOT do:</h2></p>

<p>– Mooze does not perform or operate bank FIAT transactions. The app only aggregates digital unit transfer technologies for alternative finance audiences.</p>

<p>– Mooze does not handle financial in/outflows of digital units, does not hold custody, and does not operate brokerage activities.</p>

<p>– Mooze does not conduct swaps of different digital unit pairs or monetary units. FIAT reference/digital unit operations are the responsibility of EULEN.APP and partners, which may approve or block processing of user-initiated transactions. In cases of blocking or non-processing due to malicious user behavior, operations may be reversed by Brazilian partners such as PLEBANK.COM.BR.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>6.1. What Mooze DOES:</h2></p>

<p>– Mooze only aggregates distributed ledger and digital unit conversion technologies, using networks such as Blockstream and other decentralized systems. It integrates swaps and transfers from companies like Sideswap, DEPIX.INFO, and EULEN.APP. Future technologies will be added as terms are updated.</p>

<p>– Mooze provides informational support to users, forwarding requests and inquiries to companies involved, such as EULEN.APP and its Brazilian partners. Mooze acts as a bridge between users and these services.</p>

<p>– Mooze communicates in Portuguese or English depending on demand. Communication in Portuguese does not mean Mooze is based or operating physically in Brazil.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>7. Anti-fraud policy</h2></p>

<p>Mooze may store APP IDs, which are encrypted hashes of data such as:</p>

<p>– MediaDRM, IPV4, UUID, Device Check, and others (depending on platform).</p>

<p>– The purpose is to detect real human use, avoid spam, prevent server attacks, block bots, prevent fraud, and protect EULEN.APP data processors.</p>

<p>These data:</p>

<p>– Do not identify users or specific transactions.</p>

<p>– Do not represent civil data capture, documentation, or personal identification in the Mooze app.</p>

<p>– Are only used if Mooze users cause harm to third parties through app misuse (e.g., disrupting EULEN.APP processors).</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>8. Legal obligations</h2></p>

<p>– Mooze does not store open personal data from users.</p>

<p>– Users are responsible for reporting digital units regulated by Brazilian law, as international platforms are not directly required to report to Brazil.</p>

<p>– Reports of Mooze app units for tax purposes may be requested by email at <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a>.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>8.1. Jurisdictions</h2></p>

<p>– “Otoco Matic LLC – Mooze – Series 99” operates the aggregation of partner technologies. It is recognized as a Series LLC under master company “Otoco Matic LLC” in Wyoming, USA.</p>

<p>– All legal requests are under the jurisdiction of Wyoming, USA.</p>

<p>– Operations in Brazil involving FIAT reference transfers are legally the responsibility of EULEN.APP partners, currently PLEBANK.COM.BR in Brazil, which complies with Brazilian law.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;"><p>9. Updates</h2></p>

<p>Mooze may change terms and the app at any time. Continued use means acceptance of new conditions.</p>

<p>– The user also agrees with the Privacy Policy linked at <a href="https://mooze.app/termos-e-privacidade/" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">https://mooze.app/termos-e-privacidade/</a>.</p>
