    <h1 style="color:#00ff88;margin-bottom:12px;">Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last updated: 11/13/2025</p>

         <h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">1. Acceptance of the Terms</h2>

<p>By using the Mooze application, you fully agree to these Terms of Use. This document establishes the rules for using the Mooze application, a digital unit manager with interconnected transfer functionalities linked to the real world and to the Brazilian FIAT value reference. The application aims to provide greater transactional discretion and protection of user data, analogous to the privacy offered by the use of physical FIAT currency — a right backed by fundamental constitutional guarantees of privacy and the inviolability of private life, as provided in article 5, item X, of the Federal Constitution of Brazil and in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>

          <h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">2. User Responsibilities</h2>

<p>– The user is solely responsible for keeping secure their recovery passwords for digital units in self-custody within the application. Loss of this information implies irreversible loss of the digital units inside our application.</p>

<p>– Mooze does not store or have access to private passwords or distributed ledger data of operations in the application that allow access to users’ digital unit funds.</p>

<p>– By using the “merchant mode” through the application’s operating system Mooze, the user fully accepts the terms and assumes legal responsibility for the actions performed, whether their own or by third parties who use the application as a management tool under their physical custody of the device.</p>

<p>– Instant operations in Brazilian FIAT value reference result solely in registered operations of digital units from <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>, a digital value unit equal to the Brazilian FIAT value reference.</p>

<p>– The conversion of digital units with a value different from the Brazilian FIAT value reference will occur automatically within the user’s application. Mooze does not perform operations in the traditional Brazilian financial system; it only enables the movement of digital units and automated exchanges of pairable digital units in values. This means that all transactions at the entry point of registration of <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>, upon receiving other digital units in the application when selecting assets different from DEPIX, the user is only scheduling an automated exchange of their DEPIX for another digital unit they desire. The DEPIX obtained by the same or received via digital unit gateway with value mirrored to the Brazilian FIAT value reference will be exchanged by a user request within their own application and sent from Mooze’s own digital unit reserve account. There is no custody of user digital units at any time in the aggregated technologies in the Mooze application, neither indirectly nor directly by Mooze on behalf of third parties.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">2.1. Catastrophic irreversible user actions</h2>

<p>– The user, when using the Mooze application and creating their profile, obtaining their private words and passwords or importing access via external private passwords, is responsible for saving their passwords in a secure location. This password is the only means of recovering access to their digital units in their own custody. The entire digital unit system of the application is in self-custody of the user, not of Mooze nor of the aggregated partner technologies in the Mooze application.</p>

<p>– If the user has any problem in digital unit transfers, whether for personal use or for receipts of digital units through the transaction system in Brazilian FIAT value reference via <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>, and uninstalls the application without copying and securely saving their passwords for later recovery, they will permanently lose access to their funds. This is the exclusive responsibility of the user’s self-custody. Mooze and its technology partners have no way to recover these passwords, as they are generated in the application through the user’s device and no one other than the user has access to this data. This is a characteristic of self-custody systems: the exclusive responsibility of the custodian to take care of custody. If there is no care and responsibility, these and other consequences inherent to this type of sovereign system will occur.</p>

<p>– Do not uninstall the application without saving your private recovery passwords, especially if there are digital unit funds in the application or units to be received. This may cause permanent loss of your funds. If you have any problem with digital unit transfers, do not uninstall the application, save your private passwords and, if necessary, contact Mooze support at <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a> or via support on the <a href="https://t.me/Moozep2pbot" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Telegram support channel</a>.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">2.2. Security behaviors and technologies</h2>

<p>- Mooze has cryptographic data protection systems for user IDs and their transaction requests with partner companies of <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a>, such as Plebank in national territory. Digital unit transaction data is guaranteed by encrypted distributed ledger technology via the Liquid Network of the company <a href="https://blockstream.com" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Blockstream</a>, or by similar open-source and decentralized cryptographic ledger technologies. Responsibility for FIAT value reference operations data in Brazilian territory lies with the company Plebank, which maintains its own secure systems and compliance in Brazil.</p>

<p>- Mooze does not have security systems for recovering user application access or access to users’ digital units who lose their private passwords. Custody is the exclusive responsibility of the user, who must keep their private passwords secure.</p>

<p>- The user must be responsible for storing their private passwords. If they are leaked by notes in insecure locations by the user, it may give malicious access to their digital unit funds. The user may suffer loss of funds in these cases and in cases of physical breach of access to their device. Mooze has no responsibility for these cases and does not offer systems to prevent access unbeknownst to the user with passwords leaked due to their own negligence. Avoid hacks in digital locations and do not save your passwords in locations without encryption. Prefer to store your personal passwords in a physically secure location.</p>

<p>- Unauthorized access to the user’s physical device, whether by coercion, theft or loss of the same, is the responsibility of the user. All care with self-custody of private passwords and care for the device with the installed application is the responsibility of the user, who accepts these terms when using the application.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">3. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>- Mooze is not responsible for losses or problems arising from the use of the application, especially in cases that include network failures (e.g., problems in distributed data registry networks, soft/hard forks), unconfirmed operations or user errors in these networks. The distributed registry networks in which transaction histories of digital units are scanned (public mempools) are not controlled by Mooze, but by third parties, such as <a href="https://blockstream.com" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Blockstream</a> and associates or open-source decentralized distributed registries.</p>

<p>- The Mooze application is operating as a BETA mode application and in release version soon, having both versions at the same time for a determined period. The user agrees that problems may occur if using the BETA version. If critical problems occur that prevent movement of their digital units, Mooze application users’ private passwords are compatible with recovery in the <a href="https://blockstream.com" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Blockstream</a> application. If the user recovers their private passwords in the aforementioned application, they will be able to move their digital units in cases of unexpected critical incompatibility or some disaster case in the programming of the code of the Mooze application that they are using in open BETA mode that prevents the movement of digital units or even some problem not mentioned here occurs in any Mooze platform version.</p>

<p>- Mooze and the partner digital unit processors do not participate in activities between users and customers. The Mooze application system is only a technological bridge. Mooze only aggregates technologies from other companies, such as <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> and <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>. In cases of commercial purposes of the digital unit system through our application, it is the full responsibility of the user. Mooze does not work with accounting issues and insertion of tax data (invoices or any similar services). Users may, on their own, use regularizations under current legislation in Brazil, using the legal entity (CNPJ) of the Brazilian FIAT value reference processors of the company <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a>, such as Plebank, and others that may in the future become part of the digital data processors of the company <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a>.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">4. Monetary appreciation</h2>

<p>The monetary appreciations of digital units that are not of the official Brazilian FIAT value reference will be determined by Mooze through scanning the main known market pricing sources, to obtain an average and generate their own monetary price in the application; these values will be reference values for the provision of collateral redemption services of DEPIX, Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">5.a) Fees include:</h2>

<p>- Network fees (fees charged by distributed registry networks).</p>

<p>- Operational fees for operations in Brazilian FIAT value reference of the partners <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a>.</p>

<p>- Digital units issued to the user’s custody will already include all the fees mentioned above.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">5.b) Confirmations:</h2>

<p>- In case of problems with instant transactions in Brazilian FIAT value reference or digital unit transfer within the application, support must be contacted via <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a>.</p>

<p>- All operations are protected with Liquid Network technology against data leakage and exposure to third parties not involved in the digital unit transfer, rest assured, because if any end of the entry systems via Liquid Network has privacy failures, whether due to the Brazilian financial system or mandatory direct reports, your addresses and privacy of assets are protected by the privacy-of-choice technology and not anonymity, called “Confidential Transactions”, in which onchain analyses and pursuit of private property of users are protected by their choice to reveal assets or values, by the system of the network known as Blinding Factors.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">6. What Mooze DOES NOT DO:</h2>

<p>- Mooze does not perform or operate transactions in banking FIAT reference. The application is only an aggregator of digital unit transfer technologies through transactions in Brazilian FIAT value reference for the alternative finance public, performed by BaaS and EaaS partners in Brazil and abroad.</p>

<p>- Mooze does not perform entries or exits of financial transactions in the face of digital units, does not hold custody of digital units on behalf of third parties, does not act or perform brokerage operations and does not operate as a broker. All asset transmission operations occur in an automated manner, initially scheduled by users on their platform.</p>

<p>- Mooze does not perform exchanges of digital units of different parities or monetary units. Operations in Brazilian FIAT value reference/digital units are the responsibility of and operated by <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> and its partners, who have the decision power to accept to process or not the digital operations initiated by users within the application. In case of blocks or non-processing of digital units with operations in FIAT reference, they may be reversed if the user is identified in malicious use behavior of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> system via <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>, through its current or future partners in Brazil.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">6.1. What Mooze DOES:</h2>

<p>- Mooze only aggregates digital unit data transfer technologies by distributed registry systems and digital unit conversion. We use distributed registry networks, for example that of the consolidated company <a href="https://blockstream.com" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Blockstream</a> and its federation of dozens of federates, of which Mooze is part among other open-source decentralized ones. We use exchange systems between and by digital units of the companies: Sideswap, <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>, <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> and its legally regulated partners in Brazilian territory and not only these mentioned if necessary. New technologies, when aggregated to the application, will have the companies mentioned in new changes to these Terms of Use.</p>

<p>- Mooze provides informational support to application users through electronic channels, forwarding information and user requests to the companies involved in the use of the application’s technologies, such as for example <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> and its partners in Brazilian territory. This means that Mooze acts as a bridge between the user and the services of these companies’ technologies via application or via requests in electronic channels for support/forwarding of information.</p>

<p>- Mooze communicates in Portuguese or English, depending on the demand, type of user or entity that requires this communication. Communications in Brazilian Portuguese do not mean that Mooze has headquarters or physical operation in Brazil. Mooze has headquarters and operation in the United States of America, in the city of Wyoming.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">7. Anti-Fraud Policy</h2>

<p>Mooze may store APP IDs, consisting of encrypted hashes of data such as MediaDRM, IPv4, UUID, Device Check and others of equivalent nature, according to the platform used. This measure aims to identify legitimate human use, prevent spam, mitigate attacks on servers, prevent the use of the application by robots or fraud, as well as protect the partner data processing companies of the company <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a>.</p>

<p>The aforementioned data seen alongside processing at Mooze in its jurisdiction:</p>

<p>- Do not allow user identification nor reveal the nature of specific transactions.</p>

<p>- Do not constitute collection of civil information, documentation or personal identification on the Mooze platform.</p>

<p>- Will be used exclusively in cases where application users cause damage to third parties through their use, such as interference in the operations of partner data processing companies of <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> that result in damages or require judicial interventions in legal proceedings involving such partners.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">8. Legal Obligations</h2>

<p>- Mooze does not store open personal data of its users.</p>

<p>- The user is responsible for reporting the application’s digital units that may eventually be subject to legal regulation in Brazil, since current Brazilian legislation imposes this obligation on users of international platforms, which have no direct reporting obligation to the Country.</p>

<p>- Information related to the Mooze application’s digital units, for purposes of declaration eventually required, may be requested through the email <a href="mailto:suporte@mooze.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">suporte@mooze.app</a>.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">8.1. Of jurisdictions</h2>

<p>– “Otoco Matic LLC – Mooze – Series 99” is the company that holds the aggregator operation of all technologies of the partners mentioned in these terms, hereinafter simply referred to as “Mooze”. It is a Series LLC constituted under the master LLC “Otoco Matic LLC”, with jurisdiction and headquarters in the United States of America, in the State of Wyoming.</p>

<p>All legal requests regarding the operations and structure of the company will be resolved under the jurisdiction of the United States of America, in the State of Wyoming, elected as the forum for judicial actions and legal responses.</p>

<p>The operations carried out in Brazilian territory through the Mooze application – consisting of the delivery of aggregated systems of transfers and exchanges of digital units based on current FIAT value reference via DEPIX system – are the legal responsibility of the partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network that operate in Brazil, which fully observe the applicable norms, laws and regulations in the Country.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">9. Non-Custodial Transaction Model and Asset Delivery Contract</h2>

<p>By accepting these Terms of Use, the user agrees with the Mooze service provision model described below:</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">A) Acquisition of Digital Assets via Mooze</h2>

<p>All acquisitions of digital units carried out through Mooze are governed by these Terms of Use, which regulate the software intermediation services for transmission of digital units. Any acquisition of assets made through fiat currency payments to global partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network, through Banking as a Service (BaaS) in Brazil, refers exclusively to DEPIX – synthetic unitary digital token partially collateralized in fiat currencies and mostly in Bitcoin, through on-chain networks and/or the Liquid Network, as described by the issuing entity at <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a> in its public whitepaper.</p>

<p>When making the fiat payment in the Brazilian financial system, the user acquires DEPIX in the name and ownership of Mooze, acknowledging that the assets belong to Mooze at the time of the transaction. The user expressly accepts this condition by proceeding with the operation or by accepting these Terms of Use. Thus, the payment made to a BaaS partner is used to acquire DEPIX on behalf of Mooze.</p>

<p>This DEPIX acquisition contract in the name of Mooze allows the user to select, on the platform, two distinct contractual modalities, each with specific service provision, as detailed in the following items.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">B) Acquisition of Digital Units: DEPIX</h2>

<p>When selecting the DEPIX option on the platform, the user contracts the service of acquiring DEPIX in the name and ownership of Mooze. The assets are kept under Mooze’s possession to enable the execution of intermediation services through automated software. These services include addressing the DEPIX to a self-custody wallet of the user, whose address is automatically captured by Mooze’s systems through seeds or seed phrases previously registered by the user and which Mooze will never know, have knowledge of or access to.</p>

<p>In this modality, the user acquires the service of organization, addressing and orchestration of transactions on a large scale. Mooze acts as a bridge between the DEPIX token issuer and BaaS partners, using automated anti-fraud verification systems, hash generation and asset addressing. The objective is to ensure system scalability for the end user, through the purchase of DEPIX in the name of Mooze.</p>

<p>The operation may take a few minutes or hours, especially if anti-fraud systems identify suspicious behavior, such as attempts of unauthorized access to systems, endpoints or PIX transactions that may harm BaaS partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network. After completion of the verifications, Mooze deducts its service fee (related to software and automations) from the amount to be delivered. Only then are the DEPIX issued in favor of the user, becoming their ownership when transferred in a unidirectional and irreversible manner to their self-custody wallet via previously registered or created seed phrases on the platform by the user and which Mooze will never know and has no knowledge or access to.</p>

<p>If irregularities or failures are detected in the transaction of the DEPIX acquired in the name of Mooze, the assets will be returned to the issuer for reversal. In this case, the fiat payment will be refunded to the user through the PIX system, via BaaS partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network, with the consequent cancellation of the contract and the service provided.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">C) Acquisition of Digital Units: Bitcoin</h2>

<p>When selecting Bitcoin (on any blockchain network available on the platform), the user contracts the service of acquiring DEPIX in the name and ownership of Mooze. The acquired DEPIX are used by Mooze to redeem, in a decentralized manner, the majority collateral of the token – Bitcoin – in its country of operation. According to the public DEPIX whitepaper, the backing in Bitcoin is structured through NITI protocols (Non-custodial Interlinked Tokenization Infrastructure), allowing redemption via Liquid Network or Lightning networks, as detailed at <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a> in its public whitepaper.</p>

<p>In this modality, the user delivers DEPIX in the ownership of Mooze to enable the redemption of the collateral in Bitcoin. Mooze applies automated anti-fraud verification systems, addressing and orchestration of transactions on a large scale, acting as a bridge between the DEPIX issuer and BaaS partners. The service ensures scalability of addressing to the end user.</p>

<p>The operation may take a few minutes or hours, especially in case of detection of suspicious behavior by anti-fraud systems. After completion, Mooze deducts its service fee from the amount to be delivered. Only then is Bitcoin issued in favor of the user, becoming their ownership when transferred in a unidirectional and irreversible manner to their self-custody wallet via previously registered or created seed phrases on the platform by the user and which Mooze will never know and has no knowledge or access to.</p>

<p>If irregularities or failures are detected in the transaction of the DEPIX acquired in the name of Mooze, the assets will be returned to the issuer for reversal. In this case, the fiat payment will be refunded to the user through the PIX system, via BaaS partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network, with the consequent cancellation of the contract and the service provided.</p>

<p>Both contractual modalities involve the charging of fees for the use of Mooze’s transaction facilitator systems, including options optimized for merchants and direct or indirect provision of APIs or endpoints that interconnect DEPIX services to BaaS or EaaS systems (Exchange as a Service via NITI protocols only) of the token issuer.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">D) Jurisdiction of Access to Fiduciary Payment Systems</h2>

<p>Mooze makes access to acquisition services available exclusively through the Brazilian financial system, using PIX via BaaS technological bridges. Only individuals with active Brazilian citizenship, holders of a bank account in Brazil and bearers of a national identification document can use the payment services. This restriction stems from legal requirements for operations in the Brazilian financial system.</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>- BaaS (Banking as a Service): Platform that allows non-banking companies to offer financial services – such as accounts, payments and transfers – through APIs, without the need for their own banking license, provided they operate under applicable regulatory authorizations.</p>

<p>- EaaS (Exchange as a Service): Model that provides infrastructure for cryptoasset exchanges via APIs, allowing the creation of personalized platforms with a focus on compliance, liquidity and integration. In the case of Mooze and DEPIX, the NITI protocol is used (example: Sideswap and its public API).</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">10. Updates</h2>

<p>Mooze reserves the right to change these Terms of Use and the application at any time. Continued use of the platform after such modifications implies full acceptance of the new conditions; if users under terms of use of a previous date continue to use the app on recent dates of these terms, they will automatically agree with the current terms of the services clarified.</p>

<p>The user also declares to agree with the terms of the Privacy Policy, incorporated by reference and available at https://mooze.app/termos-e-privacidade/.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Last updated: 11/13/2025</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">1. Commitment to Privacy</h2>

<p>Mooze respects the privacy of users and undertakes to collect only strictly necessary data. This Policy explains the data treatment during the use of the application, the website https://mooze.app or third-party intermediary platforms. All operations observe the applicable legislation in the jurisdictions where Mooze operates, especially the constitutional principles of privacy, security and financial freedom provided for in the Federal Constitution of Brazil (art. 5) and in the Fourth Amendment of the United States.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">2. Definitions</h2>

<p>– User: any person who uses the application or interacts with Mooze platforms.</p>

<p>- Personal data: information that allows direct or indirect identification of an individual, such as name, CPF or email. Mooze does not collect them by default.</p>

<p>- APP ID: hashes generated from technical device data, used exclusively for anti-fraud and system security purposes.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">3 – Data Collection</h2>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">3.1 – We do not store:</h2>

<p>- Full name, email, CPF, documents or any sensitive direct personal identification data. The data retained by Mooze remain, for a determined time, on encrypted servers and, even in case of attack or leak, contain only hashes without connection to civil identities; Mooze does not perform automatic or mandatory reporting of transactions or provision of user services.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">3.2 – We collect:</h2>

<p>- Cryptographic hashes derived from technical device data (MediaDRM, Device Check and similar), used solely in anti-fraud mechanisms.</p>

<p>- Information necessary to protect the platform against bots, misuse or financial fraud.</p>

<p>- Blockchain addresses and encrypted blinding keys of operations on the Liquid Network related to FIAT financial transactions, retained exclusively to ensure the delivery of contracted services and the effectiveness of anti-fraud systems.</p>

<p>These data are kept under Mooze jurisdiction, distinct from the jurisdiction of the payment processing partners of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network and are not accessible to third parties unrelated to the execution of transactions.</p>

<p>Such information is not stored in public databases and does not allow the identification of the user’s civil identity, ensuring security and privacy.</p>

<h2 style="color:#00ff88;margin:10px 0;">4. Digital Operations in Current Fiduciary Value Reference</h2>

<p>Data of transactions such as CPF, holder name or unique keys associated with the Brazilian instant transfer system are handled exclusively by the partner processors of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network, such as Plebank (in Brazilian territory) and possible future members of the network.</p>

<p>Mooze does not store or access these personal data through the application. It only performs readings of usage data to confirm legitimate human interaction, discarding possible robot actions, spam or attacks on servers (DDoS).</p>

<p>The application operates in a digital unit self-custody model, without collection of personal data or invasive identification procedures. Interactions with the Brazilian instant payment system are intermediated by the processors of the <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> network.</p>

<p>The responsibility for possible legal reports of transactions with digital units falls on the user, under the terms of art. 5 of Normative Instruction RFB nº 1.888/2019, or current rules on the date of your reading here, since neither Mooze nor the processors exercise custody of assets. Mooze provides non-custodial infrastructure for the acquisition and receipt of digital units, resulting from the operations of <a href="https://eulen.app" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Eulen.app</a> and <a href="https://www.depix.info" target="_blank" style="color:#00ff88;text-decoration:underline;">Depix.info</a>.

<p>Under the terms of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), the user has the right to request information about the data processed – even if limited to hashes without connection to civil identity. Deletion of the APP ID identifier or its refusal can be requested through the same email channel. Once the request is met, the hashes will be deleted and access to the digital unit gateway via FIAT services will be deactivated for the device. In case of reinstallation, the device access to services through FIAT means remains blocked until a new formal request, sent by the same email used in the deletion, with express full acceptance of these Terms again when making the request for new inclusion in the services.</p>
